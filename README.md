# Angular 2 JumpStart with TypeScript and new Router

The goal of this jumpstart app is to provide
a simple way to get started with Angular 2 while also showing several key Angular 2 features. The sample
relies on System.js to load TypeScript modules and the required scripts used in the application.

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started

## Angular 2 Concepts Covered
